# grub-beep-tester

Actually it has features that are not available for Grub beep feature, so it's more of a fun project with building simple web-based audio creation software. 

Not working on it since I wrote this project and then it turned out I've lost the beeper for my motherboard ;( one less avenue for flexing in front of windows and mac users for me...

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.4. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
